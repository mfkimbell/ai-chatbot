# ai-chatbot

You need to open vscode through Anaconda or streamlit will not function properly

Things I need to explain:

p 
k 
temperature

streamlit is particularly useful for data science since you can quickly build a frontend for proof of concept


how to test locally:

docker pull mfkimbell/ai-chatbot:latest

docker run --env-file .env -p 8501:8501 ai-chatbot:latest
